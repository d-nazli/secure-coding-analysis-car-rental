🚗 Secure Coding Analysis — Car Rental

Static Code Analysis of a Car Rental Application

This project focuses on analyzing a Python-based car rental system using static code analysis tools to evaluate code quality, security risks, and maintainability without executing the application.

🔍 Static Analysis Tools Used

Pylint – Code quality, style, and potential logic issues

Bandit – Security vulnerability detection

Radon – Code complexity and maintainability metrics

Vulture – Detection of unused code and dead functions

🎯 Project Goal

Identify security weaknesses and bad coding practices

Measure code complexity and maintainability

Improve secure coding awareness

Provide an educational secure-coding case study
